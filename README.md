# Single-Perceptron-Classifier
Simple Single Perceptron Classifier in Various Situations

A single Perceptron Classifier for 3 Datasets and 3 Problems

	1. P1_1.m , P1_1.fig 
	  A perceptron classifying the "Iris" dataset (Shuffled_Dataset1.data) which has 4 features (inputs) and 3 classes, in a one-versus-all manner.
	  Plotting 3 figures, each showing the training and test error rates for one separate perceptron classifying a class from 2 others.
	  The learning rate, the stopping condition and its parameters, and training and validation ratios for dividing the data can be changed by the user through the GUI.
	
	2.P_1_2_G.m , P_1_2_G.fig
	  A perceptron classifying dataset2 (Shuffled_Dataset2.data) which has 2 features (inputs) and 2 classes.
	  Plotting 3 figures, each showing the training and test error rates for one separate perceptron classifying the data with different random initial weights.
	  The learning rate, the stopping condition and its parameters, and training and validation ratios for dividing the data can be changed by the user through the GUI.
	
	3.P1_3.m , P1_3.fig
	  A second degree perceptron classifying dataset3 (Shuffled_Dataset3.data) which has 2 features (inputs) and 2 classes and is not linearly separable.
	  Plotting 2 figures, one showing the weights changing during training, the second showing the classification result on the data.
	  The learning rate, the stopping condition and its parameters, and training and validation ratios for dividing the data can be changed by the user through the GUI.
